# SR-GNN_PyTorch-Geometric

A reimplementation of SRGNN.

(WARNING: The computation of session embedding only uses embedding W.R.T. nodes in a session graph while in the paper, the calculation based on the whole session sequence, which means they may calculate re-occur items as many times as they occue.)

Original code from [here](https://github.com/CRIPAC-DIG/SR-GNN). Original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00855).

Borrow the data preprocessing from original repo, including `diginetica` and `yoochoose`.

Using PyTorch 1.0, [TensorboardX](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX), [PyTorch-Geometric 1.1.3](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) and [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm).

## Data preparation

1) Follow the steps in original code repo to get `train.txt` and `test.txt` for every dataset.

2) Put both `tain.txt` and `test.txt` in the `raw` folder W.R.T. different datasets.

## Training and testing

    cd src
    python main.py --dataset=diginetica
